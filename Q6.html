    <h1>Sports Information</h1>
    <p>Sports are defined as competitive or recreational activities that involve the use of physical skill,
        intelligence, and hand-eye
        coordination. Down through history, people have invented sporting activities as a way to display physical
        abilities, to offer
        exciting contests, and to socialize and entertain each other. Early games were probably based on survival
        activities, such as
        hunting and gathering, whereas the more organized sports of today continue to serve as recreational diversions,
        and as physical
        and emotional outlets.
