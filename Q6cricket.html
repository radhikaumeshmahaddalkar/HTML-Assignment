    <p>Cricket is the world's most popular bat-and-ball game, it is played between two teams of eleven players each on a
        field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
        balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls"
        (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed
        once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the
        player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side
        scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the
        field, or the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to
        prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means
        of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
        fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before
        a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been
        dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more runs
        wins, provided that the other team has completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by
        two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>
    <p>The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the
        expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.
        The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of
        which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by
        Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United
        Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.</p>
